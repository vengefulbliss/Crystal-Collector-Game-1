# Pokemon Crystal-Collector-Game

## Week 4 Homework Assignment


The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Hangman. 
This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

 Here's how the game works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as pokemon buttons on the page.

   * The user will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the user clicks on a pokemon, it will add a specific amount of points to the user's total score. 

   * The user wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The user loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the user wins or loses.
